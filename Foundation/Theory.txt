RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION (RAG) – THEORY

What is RAG?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI approach that combines information retrieval with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate accurate, context-aware responses.
Instead of relying only on the model’s internal training data, RAG retrieves relevant external information and uses it while generating answers.

In simple terms:
RAG = Retrieve relevant data + Generate answer using LLM

Why RAG is Important
Large Language Models have limitations:

They are trained on static data

They cannot access private or updated information

They may hallucinate incorrect answers

They have limited context window (memory size)

RAG overcomes these problems by:

Allowing LLMs to use external knowledge

Supporting private and custom datasets

Reducing hallucinations

Producing grounded and reliable outputs

Core Components of a RAG System

Data Source
External knowledge such as PDFs, text files, databases, web pages, or APIs.

Preprocessing and Chunking
Large documents are split into smaller chunks so they can fit into the model’s context window.

Embedding Model
Each text chunk is converted into numerical vectors (embeddings) that represent semantic meaning.

Vector Database
Embeddings are stored in a vector database to enable fast similarity search.

Retriever
Given a user query, the retriever finds the most relevant chunks from the vector database.

Large Language Model (LLM)
The LLM receives the user query along with the retrieved context and generates the final response.

How RAG Works (High-Level Flow)

User asks a question

The question is converted into embeddings

Relevant document chunks are retrieved from the vector database

Retrieved content is added to the prompt

The LLM generates a final answer based on this context

Context Window and RAG
Each LLM has a fixed context window, which defines how many tokens it can process at one time.
RAG helps manage this limitation by retrieving only the most relevant information instead of passing entire documents.
